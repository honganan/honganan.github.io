# Projects

**Responsible for the Observability System at Tuya, including:**

- **Loki Log Implementation and User Training:** Successfully implemented Loki logs at Tuya, replacing Elasticsearch (ES) and reducing log costs by 80%. Enhanced Loki's functionality and performance to meet internal needs, including:

  - **Cross-Availability Zone Federation Query:** Resolved cross-zone traffic issues.
  - **Query Scheduling Optimization:** Improved query scheduling fairness.
  - **Log Data Masking:** Ensured data privacy.
  - **UI Experience Enhancement:** Improved user interface.
  - **Innovative Full-Text Bloom Index:** Developed a high-performance, lightweight S3-based full-text Bloom index.
  - **Log Collection Pipeline Optimization:** Enhanced log delivery and consumption, significantly improving performance.
  - **System Stability and Performance:** Ensured stability and performance despite a doubling in log volume.

  **Key Achievements:**

  The self-developed Bloom index uses only 1/5  of the resources compared to the community version, with lower latency and query data volume reduced to a fraction of a thousandth of the community version.

- **Skywalking Optimization and Enhancement:** Conducted user training and technical sharing, focusing on:
  - **System Stability Improvement:** Enhanced system reliability.
  - **Tail Sampling (Error Trace Sampling):** Implemented tail sampling for error traces.
  - **Support for Self-Developed Middleware:** Integrated and tested self-developed middleware.
  - **Trace Identification Mechanism:** Laid the foundation for root cause analysis.

- **Monitoring System Upgrade:** Led the phased upgrade and transformation of the monitoring system.

- **Community Contributions:** Submitted multiple bug fixes and optimizations to the Loki, Skywalking, and vector.dev communities.
